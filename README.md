# Diagnosis-of-Alzheimers
This Repository contains code and analysis results for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease on the Oasis-3 dataset.
An input image is classified in four classes(Mild-Demented,Moderate-Demented,Non-demented,Very-Mild-Demented) with the help of the ML model.   
The Repository contains the following contents:      
**Augmented.ipynb**: This script can be used for reducing imbalances present between different classes in our training dataset.      
**Alzheimer's_Diagnosis.ipynb**: Contains the tuned ML model that is used for classification      
**Classification_report.ipynb**:Script for generating confusion matrix      
**Best_perfromance_with_Adam.pdf**:Contains the Epoch information,training and testing accuracy for the best perfromance achieved using the  tuned ML-network with Adam optimizer. The testing dataset accuracy was found to be above 70% for every run.       
**Diagnosis_of_Alzheimers.docx**:Contains a detailed report illustrating different approaches and the process of fine tuning the parameters before selection of final model.
